A charactersheet tool for DND 5E. My first web project, using angular and bootstrap with a theme from bootswatch.

Can create a new character with default stat values. Once you enter new values, skills and saving throws will automatically update while 
also considering the characters proficiency bonus.

Spellbook button will bring up a spellbook view for the character where the user can add and remove cantrips and spells for every spell level
as well as spellslot values. 

Save button in the bottom right corner will download the charactersheet's values to a JSON format file on the users machine. 
Opening an existing charactersheet will allow the user to enter a JSON format file and populate character values from it. 
Button in bottom left hides all of the charactersheet display and shows an in progress stage of my own original artwork for a personal character. 

Future updates will likely rework the spellbook display for better viewing on different screen sizes. There are also plans for a diceroller 
utility to be added later.
