The purpose of this website was to be a fun first personal web development project that I might use on my portfolio as well as in my personal life.

It was built using Angular, Bootstrap, a theme from Bootswatch, and a piece of personal artwork.

Data for the charactersheet is stored in JSON format.

It's current working state is usable for most of Dnd 5th edition. There are still some tweaks that I'd like to work out such as mobile support, making it properly responsive, and eventually adding the softer parts of the character sheet, a dice roller, and a way to upload your own character art.
